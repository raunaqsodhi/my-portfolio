Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.<br/><br/>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at legal@circle.so and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim through binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or Kings County, New York, unless you and we agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.

All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.","title":"Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration"},"disputes_with_third_parties":{"description":"CIRCLE IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY NON-EMPLOYEE WORKER, BUYER, OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE, AND ANY DISPUTE YOU HAVE WITH ANY NON-EMPLOYEE WORKER, BUYER, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OTHER USER OF THE SERVICE, IS DIRECTLY BETWEEN YOU AND THAT THIRD PARTY, AND YOU IRREVOCABLY RELEASE CIRCLE FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THOSE DISPUTES.

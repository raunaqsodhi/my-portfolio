Team members are generally left to their own devices during this time. All that really matters is that they complete the work they've been assigned by the end of the two-week period.\n\nThis is a common approach in the modern tech industry and is designed to minimize interference with your personal time management while allowing the team as a whole to keep moving forward. Everyone can regularly deliver results and receive feedback from colleagues and bosses.\n\nYou are going to discover what data analysis is and do your research as an analyst. You will learn the basics of Python, a key tool in the profession. This course will help you decide if you have the time and motivation to go all the way.\n\n\\\\\\\\{quiz-task\\\\\\\\}\nheader: 'Deadline Bonus'\ncontent: 'To help you keep track of your progress during the sprint, we have provided you with a timer, which will show you how much time you have left.\n\nIf you manage to complete three chapters of the free course in the space of a week, you will get a 20% discount on the paid program.\n\nIf you do it within two weeks, we will give you a 10% discount.\n\n\nIf you finish the first seven lessons (up until Comments) today and keep up that pace, you will finish the sprint in time.'\nbackground: '#D8E4F5'\n\\\\\\\\{/quiz-task\\\\\\\\}\n\n", "trainer.fastTrack.timer.agenda.profession.dataScientist.md": "Welcome to TripleTen!\n\nWe're excited to show you our online platform.
